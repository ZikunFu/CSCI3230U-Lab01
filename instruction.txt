For the first week, create the skeleton of a web-based sudoku game, implemented as two web pages, a game page and a high scores page.
For this, you need to create 2 HTML pages named: sudoku.html and high_scores.html. For each HTML file, please add the default HTML tags in the same way we did in the first lecture.

Three folders: images, scripts and styles. Inside the images folder, adds the two attached images. Create a CSS file inside the styles folder name it sudoku.css. We will keep the scripts folder empty for now.

The final structure should be as follow:
sudoku_game/
|--- images/
|         |---  logo.gif
|         |--- undo.png
|---scripts/
|---styles
|        |---sudoku.css
|--- sudoku.html
|--- high_scores.html

After you finish, please upload your code to a GitHub (Links to an external site.) repository and provide the link to your GitHub repository.
